This repository provides example code and data reproduce some
of the key results in "Geotagged tweets to inform a spatial interaction model: a case study of museums",
a paper submitted to [Geo-spatial Information Science](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tgsi20).

A
preprint of this paper that describes the method in more
detail and provides context, is available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/):
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5118

To run the reproducible code, open R in the directory of this
repository (downloaded via the
[Download ZIP](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/twitter-leeds/archive/master.zip)
button on the right) and run, preferably line by line, the
code contained in the "si-museums.R" script. "tfc.R" needs to
be run after this for the callibration code to work.
