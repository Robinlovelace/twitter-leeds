Analysis of Twitter data from Leeds, based on data harvested by Nick Malleson and Kirk Harland for the Talisman node of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). This is the public repository of the project. Please contact me at my leeds email address if you would like access to the raw data. 

Also see my [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/robinlovelace) account and [personal website](http://robinlovelace.net) for more preliminary results from this work.
